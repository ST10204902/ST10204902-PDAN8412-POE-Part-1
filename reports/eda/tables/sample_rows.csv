him as it had been in spite of had made him an advocate with her of her own and his friend s interests he had not used such of speech as the occasion demanded and as he had intended to use he had spared her where it had been weakness to do so namely in the picture he had drawn of the ruin that must overtake her if she listened to richard s dick s mention of his aunt had at once suggested to mr the ally most likely to be of service � of the same sex as the lady herself and therefore not likely to be moved as he had been by her attractions and one moreover who had already her upon this very question and come off victorious he felt that not a moment was to be lost if either of these two young people were to be saved and therefore that very morning after but scant measure of sleep mr presented himself in street his visit was therefore made upon the sunday morning a circumstance which the of the case might well have excused only unfortunately mr had forgotten it was sunday folks who go to church are at all events in a better position than those who don t for knowing the day of the week and our young friend i regret to say was in this respect at a disadvantage sister s view of the seventh day was not of course so severe as some people s� as that of mrs would have been for example � but it was out for her like a board with services from to � in which not a square was vacant and certainly not for such a person as a morning she therefore received mr with a certain of manner which at first staggered and when he found out the reason him exceedingly he sister on account of her practical benevolence and it put him out of patience to think how she wasted herself such was his view of the matter over sundays priests and saints days it must be an important affair mr that brings you here on a sunday morning was the remark with which she met him mr thought instantly of that exception which is made respecting one s ox or one s ass falling into a pit � and was there not an ass at all events about to fall into a pit in this case but his good manners saved him from the quotation what he did say however was one man one day above another another every day alike sister blushed for she felt herself like most ladies of her peculiar views she had had the strained for her through the and was not so fully acquainted with them as might be wished in their if she had been less the thought of the devil quoting scripture for his own ends would immediately have occurred to her but as it was she only sweetly said i beg your pardon sir it is true i have no right to judge you this brought her visitor to his at once you are twenty thousand times better than i madam only one likes to have one s own opinion it is however as you have said no light matter that causes me to intrude upon yon your nephew is on the very verge what what ejaculated sister clasping her hands marrying an she had thought he was going to say death or ruin and tried in vain to look as if this news had not relieved her oh mr how terrible well it s very bad of course i come to you as a last chance dick himself is deaf to upon the matter but perhaps you might persuade the lady to reject him it is she was duly shocked of course but what was demanded of her was at least more practicable than if the young had been unknown to her then he unfolded to her how it had all happened nor did he refrain from dwelling upon his friend s habits of extravagance or withhold from her the increasing peril of his social position with this however she appeared to be already acquainted or perhaps considerations of a higher kind overpowered her sorrow upon that account my poor dick i my poor poor dick was all she said the words might have been addressed to a pet suffering from the but the tone had such pity and love in it as touched the other s tender heart to its very core your nephew loves you still madam he said and very dearly though as he thinks you have abandoned him as good for nothing i have not abandoned him cried she vehemently or at least she added with more caution if i could see my way to help him i would take it i felt sure you would miss when i came here here is the address of madame � that is the lady s stage name sister sighed as may be supposed to sigh when allusion is made to another place of course i will go she said there is no time to be lost in going suggested mr i understand i am aid i must leave you now she already heard with her mind s ear an little bell a thousand thanks to you for coming to me these two people as far asunder in all else as the poles had at least this idea in common and it was a correct one that there was something of sterling worth in the other mr went home to his lodgings and after reading an adverse criticism in the observer on his play to bed sister repaired to st s where she tried and miserably failed to avoid thinking of poor dick and his troubles it was out of the question of course that she could pay her visit to madam �,25
an in affairs of the heart by reason of there having existed a mr who played short and was supposed to have been of her my private opinion is that this was entirely a assumption and that was altogether innocent of any such sentiments � to which he had never given any sort of expression that i could ever hear of both miss and miss had a superstition however that he would have declared his passion if he had not been ent short in his youth at about sixty by over drinking his constitution and over doing an attempt to set it right again by bath water they had a lurking suspicion even that he died of secret love though i must say there was a picture of him in the house with a nose which concealment did not appear to have ever upon we will not said miss enter on the past of this matter our poor brother s death has that we had not said miss been in the habit of frequent association with our brother francis but there was no decided division or between us francis took his road we took ours we considered it to the happiness of all parties that it should be so and it was so each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak shook her head after speaking and became upright when silent miss never moved her arms she sometimes played tunes upon them her of and i should think never moved our niece s position or supposed position is much by our brother francis s death said miss and therefore we consider our brother s opinions as regarded her position as being changed too we have no reason to doubt mr that you are a young gentleman possessed of good qualities and honor able character or that you have an affection � or are fully persuaded that you have an affection � for our i replied as i usually did i had a chance that nobody had ever loved anybody else as i loved came to my assistance with a tory murmur miss was going on to make some when miss who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother francis struck in again if s mamma she said when she married our brother francis had at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner table it would have been better for the happiness of all parties sister said miss perhaps we needn t mind that now sister said miss it belongs to the subject with your branch of the subject on which alone you are competent to speak i should not think of interfering on this branch of the subject i have a voice and an it would have been better for the happiness of all parties if s mamma when she our brother francis had mentioned plainly what her intentions were we should then have known what we the personal history experience had to expect we should have said pray do not us at any time and all possibility of ing would have been avoided when miss had shaken her head miss resumed again referring to my letter through her eye glass they both had little bright round twinkling eyes by the way which were like bird s eyes they were not unlike birds altogether having a sharp brisk sudden manner and a little short way of a themselves like miss as i have said resumed you ask permission of my sister and myself mr to visit here as the accepted of our niece if our brother francis said miss breaking out again if i may call anything so calm a breaking out wished to surround himself with an atmosphere of doctors and of doctors only what right or desire had we to object none i am sure we have ever been far from wishing to ourselves on any one but why not say so let our brother francis and his wife have their society let my sister and myself have our society we can find it for ourselves i hope as this appeared to be addressed to and me both and i made some sort of reply was i think i observed myself that it was highly creditable to all concerned i don t in the least know what i meant sister said miss having now relieved her mind you can go on my dear miss proceeded mr my sister and i have been of david careful indeed in considering this letter and we have not considered it without finally showing it to our niece and discussing it with our niece we have no doubt that you think you like her very much ma am i began oh but miss giving me a look just like a sharp as that i would not interrupt the i begged pardon affection said miss glancing at her sister which she gave in the form of a little nod to every mature affection homage devotion does not easily express itself its voice is low it is modest and retiring it lies in waits and waits such is the mature fruit sometimes a life away and finds it till in the shade of course i did not understand then that this was an allusion to her supposed experience of the stricken but i saw from the gravity with which miss nodded her head that great weight was attached to these words the light � for i call them in comparison with such sentiments the light � inclinations of very young people pursued miss are dust compared to rocks it is owing to the difficulty of knowing whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation that my sister and myself have been very how to act mr and mr said my finding himself looked at i beg pardon of the inner temple i believe said miss again glancing at,8
rags of last year s offering rewards for drowned men fluttering above i i the personal history and experience high water mark led down through the and to the ebb tide there was a story that one of the dug for the dead in the time of the great plague was and a influence seemed to have proceeded from it over the whole place or else it looked as if it had gradually into that nightmare condition out of the of the stream as if she were a part of the refuse it had cast out ind left to corruption and decay the girl we had followed strayed down to the river s brink and stood in the midst of this night e lonely and still looking at the water there were some boats and in the mud and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen i then signed to mr to remain where he was and emerged from their shade to speak to her i did not approach her solitary figure without trembling for this gloomy end to her determined walk and the way in which she stood almost within the shadow of the iron bridge at the lights reflected in the strong tide inspired a dread within me i think she was talking to herself i am sure although absorbed in gazing at the water that her shawl was off her shoulders and that she was her hands in it in an unsettled and bewildered way more like the action of a sleep than a waking person i know and never can forget that there was that in her wild manner which gave me no assurance but that she would sink before my eyes until i had her arm within my grasp at the same moment i said she uttered a terrified scream and struggled with me with such strength that i doubt if i could have held her alone but a stronger hand than mine was laid upon her and when she raised her frightened eyes nd saw whose it was she made but one more and dropped down between us we carried her away from the water to where there were some dry stones and there laid her down crying and moaning in a little while she sat among the stones holding her wretched head with both her hands oh the river she cried passionately oh the river hush hush said i yourself she still repeated the same words continually exclaiming oh the liver over and over again i know it s like me she exclaimed i know that i belong to it j know that it s the natural company of such as i am it comes country places where there was once no harm in it � and it through the dismal streets and miserable � and it goes away like my life to a great sea that is always troubled � and i feel that i must go with it have never known what despair was except in the tone of those words f i can t keep away from it i can t forget it it haunts me day and it s the only thing in all the world that i am fit for or that s fit for me oh the dreadful river the thought passed through my mind that in the face of ray companion as he looked upon her speech or motion i might have read his niece s history if i had known nothing of it i never saw in of david any painting or reality horror and compassion so blended he shook as if he would have fallen and his hand � i touched it with my own for his appearance alarmed me � was deadly cold she is in a state of frenzy i whispered to him she will speak in a little time i don t know what he would have said in answer he made some motion with his mouth and seemed to think he had spoken but he had only pointed to her with his outstretched hand a new burst of crying came upon her now in which she once more hid her face among the stones and lay before us a prostrate image of humiliation and ruin knowing that this state must pass before we could speak to her with any hope i ventured to restrain him when he would have raised her and we stood by in silence until she became more tranquil said i then leaning down and helping her to rise � she seemed to want to rise as if with the intention of going away but she was weak and leaned against a boat do you know who this is who is with me she said faintly yes do you know that we have followed you a long way to night she shook her head she looked neither at him nor at me but stood in a attitude holding her bonnet and shawl in one hand without appearing conscious of them and pressing the other clenched against her forehead are you composed enough said i to speak on the subject which so interested you � i hope heaven may remember it � that snowy night her sobs broke out afresh and she murmured some inarticulate thanks to me for not having driven her away from the door i want to say nothing for myself she said after a few moments i am bad i am lost i have no hope at all but tell sir she had shrunk away from him if you don t feel too hard to me to do it that i never was in any way the cause of his misfortune it has never been attributed to you i returned earnestly to her it was you if i don t deceive myself she said in a broken voice that came into the kitchen the night she took,8
